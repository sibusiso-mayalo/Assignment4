The function employed in this program is that of an ambulance that can move from hospital to hospital.
The ambulance moves from a given node to go to a patient. Upon arriving at the patient, it then transports the
patient to the nearest hospital. From that moment, the ambulance will move from the hospital to go to the next client.

Sample output:
Because the graph is small the program will more often print that the path does not exists.

Paths that do work:

Patient node: 2
hospital node: 1
Ambulance starting node: 3

The resulting path is 2 4 0 4 1
And the new node of the ambuulance will now be 1.

If there were many patients, the ambulance would move from node to the next victim and from the victim to the nearest hospital.
